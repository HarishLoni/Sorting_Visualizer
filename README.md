# Sorting Visualizer

A web-based application to visualize popular sorting algorithms, providing an interactive and educational experience for users to understand how these algorithms work step by step.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch sorting algorithms in action with animated visual representations.
- **Customizable Settings**:
  - Adjust the size of the array to sort.
  - Modify the sorting speed for better understanding.
- **Implemented Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for building an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **Animation**: JavaScript for dynamic updates and visualization of sorting operations.

## How It Works

1. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select one of the provided sorting algorithms from the interface.
2. **Customize Settings**: Adjust the array size and sorting speed using the provided controls.
3. **Start Visualization**: Click the "Start" button to see the sorting process in real-time.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HarishLoni/Sorting_Visualizer.git
  ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:
  ```bash
   cd Sorting_Visualizer
  ```
3. Open index.html in any modern web browser to launch the application.
## Future Enhancements
- Add more sorting algorithms like Heap Sort, Radix Sort, and Shell Sort.
- Include step-by-step explanations of each algorithm during visualization.
- Provide performance analysis (time and space complexity) for selected algorithms.
- Implement a dark mode for better user experience.
